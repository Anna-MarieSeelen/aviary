FAQs
========

This page is just meant for general questions that I notice are asked with some frequency. If you feel like something
is missing from here and you'd like to see it included, feel free to ask it by raising an issue on GitHub.

### 1) Why the name "Aviary"? Why the bird names in general?

Put all your birds in one place.

### 2) Where did the logo come from?

I made it (among other bird based + CoverM logos) using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and based the idea off of this 
[tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSOR7mPwb4I). They are very easy to make so just follow that video if you 
feel like making something similar.

### 3) Where's the paper?

You sound like my supervisor.
